// TODO: last feature is to be able to discover aggregates somehow in order to sync them, and to force rebuild of read models

// TODO: async SQLite, yes definately. Also, pass a connection string instead of the connection. SQLite seems to be working just fine with multiple connections

// TODO: make tests work again and increse test coverage and in memory support - must handle uow in event store

// TODO: a better way of doing delete where or update where - add query support and then we can loose the scope field in repository
